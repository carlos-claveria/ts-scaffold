# ts-scaffold
Basic playground and testing environment for Typescript on Windows generated by executing the `ts-scaffold.bat` file.

It is assumed that `Nodejs` is installed.

`npm` and `sed` must be available from the command line.

NOTE:
The last command `cd ..` does not work, even when trying other alternatives such as `cd %initial_dir%` where `initial_dir = %cd%`, but this issue does not impact the proper execution of the process.
